  <title>Mazur's Torsion Theorem</title>

  <p> Before out modern definition of a group had come to matruiety, 
    Beppo Levi had already conjectured that the rational points on an 
    elliptic curve which do not generate infinitely many other rational 
    points fall into one of fifteen different configurations. 
    This conjecture was rediscovered by Andrew Ogg who related it to 
    the genera of modular curves and ultimately proved by Barry Mazur 
    in his celebrated paper "Modular Curves and the Eisenstein Ideal"</p>
