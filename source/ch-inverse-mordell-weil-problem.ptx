  <title> The Inverse Mordell-Weil Problem</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
     The Mordell-Weil Problem is already a significant 
     open problem in number theory. For example, a proof of the Birch and 
     Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture would prove that an algorithm exists to compute
     the Mordell-Weil rank of an elliptic curve defined over <m> \Bbb Q </m>.

     However, this algorithm would not suddenly be optimized in such a way as to be put into general
     use for the solution to diophantine problems whose solutiosn correspond
     to rational points on elliptic curves.
