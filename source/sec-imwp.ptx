  <p> 
    My introdcution to a great deal of serious matheamtics came a the 
    Summer Undergradauate Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (SUMSRI) at
    Miami University in 2007. It was there that Edray Goins first introduced me 
    to what I've come to the inverse Mordell-Weil problem for ellitpic curves defined
    over the rational numbers.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1926, Andr√© Weil generalized a celebrated result ot L. J. Mordell. If <m> E </m> is
    an abelian variety defined over a nubmer field <m> K </m>, then the grooup
    <m> E(K) </m> of <m>K</m>-rational points on <m> E </m> is a finitely generated abelian group.
  </p>
  <p>
    The well known structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principle ideal domain
    implies that every finitely gneerated abelina group is isomorphic to one of the form
    <equation>
     <m> E(K)_{\text{tors}} \oplus \Bbb Z^{r(E,K)} </m>
    </equation>
