    Much of my work grew out of an REU, the Summer Undergradauate 
    Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (SUMSRI) at Miami University
    in 2007. Here, Edray Goins introduced me to the Mordell-Weil problem
    and its inverse problem. In particular, can you find an elliptic curve
    defined over the rational numbers with torsion subgroup 
    <m> E(\Bbb Q)_{\text{tors}} \simeq (\Bbb Z / 2 \Bbb Z) 
      \times (\Bbb Z/ 8 \Bbb Z) \times \Bbb Z^r </m> for any 
      integer <m> r \geq 4 </m>?

    In 1926, Andr√© Weil generalized a celebrated result ot L. J. Mordell. If <m> E </m> is
    an abelian variety defined over a nubmer field <m> K </m>, then the grooup
    <m> E(K) </m> of <m>K</m>-rational points on <m> E </m> is a finitely generated abelian group.
  </p>
  <p>
    The well known structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principle ideal domain
    implies that every finitely gneerated abelina group is isomorphic to one of the form
    <equation>
     <m> E(K)_{\text{tors}} \oplus \Bbb Z^{r(E,K)} </m>
    </equation>
